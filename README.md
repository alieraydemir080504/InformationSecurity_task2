### Abstract

- Anti virus and intrusion detection systems are valuable tools to minimize vulnerabilities
- But there have been new threats which are threatening national security information such as the “Advanced Persistent Threat” (APT)
- These foes may use advanced tequniques to crack the security barriers of systems
- Those who are responsible for defending these systems can gather knowledge about these adversaries and create counter measures such as feedback loops
- A kill chain model can be used for describing several phases, indicators and patterns for such attacks
- The use of such a model can be very useful for successfully countering adversary attacks

### 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain

- A kill chain in general is a process which tries to counter adversary actions
- The "chain" word is being used because of the end-to-end processes which are linked closely to the other components of this model like finx, fix, track, etc.
- In the expanded version of this concept, the attacker will try to breach into the system and work through his/her objectives
- The intrusion kill chain is being defined as reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control and actions on objectives
- Reconnaissance: Targets are bein picked which are usally being represented as email adresses or mailing lists, conference proceedings or information on technologies
- Weaponization: Seemingly harmless PDFs who are supposed to be client application files for example, could used used as a weapon which is being delivered to the systems
- Delivery: Basically these weaponized files are being transferred to the target, them mostly being websites, email attachements and USBs
- Exploitation: After the delivery of the weapon, which includes evil code, it can dig into vulnerable systems which then executes its code to harm the system
-  Installation: It enables for the trojan to keep itself alive in the system to create more harm
-  Command and Control (C2): APT malware must be interacted with manually, as soon as the C2 channel is created, the agressors have “hands on the keyboard” entry in the target system
-  Actions on Objectives: Just after successfully completing all the pahses before, the attacker can continue with their goals. The attackers may just gather some information from the victim or just try to get a better hold of the environment itself
- Own question: For the defender, which one of these phases is usually the hardest to defend? How do you proceed and what exactly are the difficulties?
